          **Entertainment category titles get more views than Gaming
        *Built regression and classification models including:
          **ElasticNet Regression
          **ElasticNet with BERT Embeddings
          **BERT Classification Model
        *BERT classifier achieved best accuracy of 76% in predicting title strength (see plot below
